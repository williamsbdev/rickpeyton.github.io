The Ingredients

* 2 cups canned garbanzo beans, undrained
* 1/3 cup tahini
* 1/4 cup lemon juice
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 cloves garlic, halved
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 pinch paprika
* 1 teaspoon minced fresh parsley

The Steps

1. Place the garbanzo beans, tahini, lemon juice, salt and garlic in a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth. Transfer mixture to a serving bowl.
2. Drizzle olive oil over the garbanzo bean mixture. Sprinkle with paprika and parsley.
3. The original recipe called for drained chickpeas, but we found that the recipe was just too thick without introducing more liquid to the recipe.
