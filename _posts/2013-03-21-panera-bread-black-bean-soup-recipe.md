Rebecca and I absolutely love the Panera Bread Black Bean Soup Recipe and have gone through many iterations trying to replicate the flavor at home. No insider information from Panera was used to create the following recipe, but we love it and think it is a wonderful at home alternative to Paneraâ€™s recipe.

The Ingredients

* 2 Garlic Cloves
* 1 Stalk of Celery (1 piece, not 1 package)
* 1 Tomato
* 1 Lemon
* 1 Red Pepper
* Chicken Bouillon Cubes
* 2 15 oz cans of black beans
* Cumin
* Cayenne Pepper
* Salt

The Steps

1. Lightly toast the following ingredients in a pot on medium high
  * 2 cloves garlic (chopped)
  * 1 celery stalk (sliced thin)
  * heirloom tomato (diced)
  * half of a red pepper (diced)
2. Now add the following to the pot
  * 1.5 c hot water
  * 2 small bouillon cubes (smashed)
  * 1 15 oz can black beans (drained and rinsed)
3. Let this mixture cook for about 5 minutes
4. Carefully pour the contents of the pot into your blender
5. Pulse in blender for about a minute (you may want to hold a folded wash cloth or a bundle of paper towels over the cover of your blender and apply moderate pressure.)
6. Puree for just a moment
7. (optional) If you want to thicken the mixture, add about a tablespoon of cornstarch mixed with a little water. Repeat until disired thickness is achieved.
8. Add the following to the blender and pulse again
  * 1 tbsp Cumin
  * 1/4 tsp Cayenne (red) Pepper
  * 1/4 tsp Salt
9. Pour the mixture back into the pot and add
  * 1 15 oz can of black beans (drained and rinsed)
10. Simmer for about 20 minutes.
11. Add the juice of a half of a lemon just a few minutes before serving.
