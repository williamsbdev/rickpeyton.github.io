I wrapped up the Introduction to Ruby and Web Development course at Tealeaf Academy this morning by pushing my [Blackjack Game](http://blackjack.rickpeyton.com) to Heroku.

My goal was to complete the four lesson course in 4 weeks. I have a full time job and a family so my plan entering this course was to dedicate 4:30AM to 6:30AM Monday through Friday, 4:30AM to 12:00PM (with a breakfast break) on Saturday and 4:30AM to 7:30AM on Sunday.

With the exception of lesson 4 (which I completed on Wednesday rather than Sunday) this proved to be the perfect amount of time, for me, for course 1.

While I don't think that two hours per morning is always going to be enough to get into a _coding zone_, that block of time does seem to be perfect for watching the lecture videos and taking notes for the beginning of each lesson. That leaves the large chunk of time on Saturday to really get in the _zone_ and knock things out. I can always add more time on Sunday if necessary.

Rapid Prototyping with Ruby on Rails is up next and I will be moving on to that course starting next week. My goal is again to complete the four lessons in 4 weeks and I will try to use the same schedule.

I know that I benefited by having prior exposure to Ruby, HTML and CSS. If any of those syntaxes were new to me I believe that the time requirement would have been quite a bit higher.

Javascript via Jquery was the only syntax that was completely foreign to me and I plan to continue to work on that over the next couple of days.

Overall I am very pleased with my Tealeaf experience so far (read [3 Weeks with Tealeaf Academy](https://rickpeyton.com/ruby/3-weeks-with-tealeaf-academy.html) if you want to know more about why I chose Tealeaf) and I will be continuing on with the program.
