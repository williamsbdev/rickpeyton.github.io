If you love chicken wings but need something less messy for your gathering then this Texas Pete Buffalo Chicken Dip Recipe will blow you away.

The Ingredients

* 1 1/2  packages cream cheese, softened (12 ounces total)
* 1/2 cup Texas Pete Hot Sauce
* 1/2 cup Ranch salad dressing
* 3 cups shredded or diced cooked chicken (Shredded rotisserie chicken is best, but canned will get you out of the kitchen quicker)
* 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
* Additional cheese to add for topping

The Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
2.  In a medium bowl, stir together the cream cheese and sauce until well blended.
3.  Mix in the ranch dressing, chicken and cheddar cheese.
4.  Spread into a 9x13 inch baking dish(or any size will work!)
5.  cover with any additional cheese.
6.  Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven.
7.  Serve with Tostitos Scoops (but celery is good too)
