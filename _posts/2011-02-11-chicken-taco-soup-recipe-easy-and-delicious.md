The Ingredients

* 1 chopped onion
* 1 can chili beans in sauce
* 1 can black beans rinsed
* 1 can whole kernel corn rinsed
* 8 oz can tomato sauce
* 12 oz ginger ale (or beer)
* 2 10 oz cans of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilies (I usually do one mild and one hot, adjust for taste)
* 1 package taco seasoning (I use McCormick Original)
* 2 10 oz cans of white chicken

Optionally top with shredded Cheddar cheese and sour cream and maybe even some Fritos.

The Steps

1. Place the onion, chili beans, black beans, corn, tomato sauce, ginger ale, diced tomatoes and chicken in a slow cooker.
2. Add taco seasoning, and stir to blend.
3. Set slow cooker for low heat, cover, and cook for 5 hours.
4. Alternatively you can cook in a large pot on the stove. Follow the directions above then heat to a bubble and then simmer, covered, over low heat for about 30 minutes.
