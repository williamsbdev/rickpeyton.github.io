![Teach Yourself Ruby on Rails](/images/teach-yourself-ruby-on-rails.jpg "Teach Yourself Ruby on Rails")

This post is about the path I am taking to teach myself Ruby on Rails. I will
be reviewing the resources I am using along the way and updating this post
and track when necessary.

I really do like the idea of Rails bootcamps. If I was in a different place
in my life I probably would take the opportunity to shut out everything else
and deep dive into Rails 16 hours a day for 4 months.

But I have a job I want to keep, a wife I want to stay married to and a child
I want to be here for. All of this means that I need to find a different way.

I am working through these resources from 4am to 6am on weekdays and 4am
to 7am on the weekend. I have skipped a couple of days here and there. I even
skipped a week once when I was sick and extremely fatigued. But mornings are
the only way I can make this happen and I am going to make this happen.

While working through this list I will also be applying what I am learning
to a project at work rebuilding a B2B ordering portal. I will also be
periodically doing Ruby coding exercises to improve my programming skills
overall. If you have any suggestions or questions please feel free to [contact
me](/contactme.html).
